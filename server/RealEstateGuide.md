## How to Buy a Home
1. **Determine your budget**: Calculate down payment and monthly mortgage.
2. **Get Pre-Approved**: Contact a lender to see how much you can borrow.
3. **Find an Agent**: A good agent will help navigate the market.
4. **Search Properties**: Look for homes that meet your criteria (beds, baths, location).
5. **Make an Offer**: Your agent will help negotiate the price.
6. **Inspection**: Ensure the property is in good condition.
7. **Closing**: Sign the papers and get the keys!

## Renting vs Buying
Buying builds equity but has upfront costs. Renting offers flexibility but no equity suitable.

## Fees
Expect closing costs, property taxes, and potential HOA fees.
